Edit the examples/flash.rs file in an editor with the following code: extern crate rust_gpiozero;\nuse rust_gpiozero::*;\nuse std::thread::sleep;\nuse std::time::Duration; fn main() { // Tell the Pi which GPIO pin you are using\nlet mut led = LED::new(17); loop{ // Make the led switch on led.on(); // Let the LED stay on for one second sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); // Make the led switch off led.off(); // Let the LED stay off for one second sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); }\n} Run run flash example by running the following command: cargo run --example flash The LED should be flashing on and off. To exit the program press Ctrl + C on your keyboard. In rust_gpiozero , an LED has a blink method which allows you to simplify the above code. The method takes two parameters, on_time and off_time . on_time is the number of second(s) the LED should stay on and off_time is the number of second(s) that the LED should stay off. Modify your code to the following: extern crate rust_gpiozero;\nuse rust_gpiozero::*; fn main() { // Tell the Pi which GPIO pin you are using let mut led = LED::new(17); // let the LED blink indefinitely, staying on for 1 sec and off for 1 sec led.blink(1,1);\n} Run the code. The LED should blink indefinitely, staying on for one second and off for one second. To exit the program press Ctrl + C on your keyboard.

GPIO stands for General-Purpose Input/Output. These pins are a physical interface between the Raspberry Pi and the outside world. At the simplest level, you can think of them as switches that you can turn on or off (input) or that the Pi can turn on or off (output). The GPIO pins allow the Raspberry Pi to control and monitor the outside world by being connected to electronic circuits. The Pi is able to control LEDs, turning them on or off, run motors, and many other things. It's also able to detect whether a switch has been pressed, the temperature, and light. We refer to this as physical computing. There are 40 pins on the Raspberry Pi (26 pins on early models), and they provide various different functions. If you have a RasPiO pin label, it can help to identify what each pin is used for. Make sure your pin label is placed with the keyring hole facing the USB ports, pointed outwards. Image source: Raspberry Pi Foundation If you don't have a pin label, then this guide can help you to identify the pin numbers: Image source: Raspberry Pi Foundation You'll see pins labelled as 3V3, 5V, GND and GP2, GP3, etc: 3V3 3.3 volts Anything connected to these pins will always get 3.3V of power 5V 5 volts Anything connected to these pins will always get 5V of power GND ground Zero volts, used to complete a circuit GP2 GPIO pin 2 These pins are for general-purpose use and can be configured as input or output pins ID_SC/ID_SD/DNC Special purpose pins WARNING : If you follow the instructions, then playing about with the GPIO pins is safe and fun. Randomly plugging wires and power sources into your Pi, however, may destroy it, especially if using the 5V pins. Bad things can also happen if you try to connect things to your Pi that use a lot of power; LEDs are fine, motors are not. If you're worried about this, then you might want to consider using an add-on board such as the Explorer HAT until you're confident enough to use the GPIO directly.","title":"GPIO pins"},"step_11.html#add-a-buzzer":{"id":"step_11.html#add-a-buzzer","body":"Now you'll add your buzzer to make some noise.
