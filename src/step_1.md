# Physical Computing with Rust

### Acknowledgement

This guide is based on [_Physical Computing with Python_](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing) by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

### What you will do

Learn how to use the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi to interface with electronic components, such as LEDs and PIRs using the Rust programming language.

### What you will learn

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/)

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)

### What you already need to know

- Basic programming concepts
- Basic understanding of programming in Rust

**It is highly recommended that you complete the first 3 chapters of [_The Rust Programming Language Book_ v2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)**
