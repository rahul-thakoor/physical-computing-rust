### Acknowledgement

This guide is an adapted version of the [_Physical Computing with Python_](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing) by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).


### What you already need to know

- Basic programming concepts
- Basic understanding of programming in Rust

**It is highly recommended that you complete atleast the first 3 chapters of [_The Rust Programming Language Book_ v2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)**

### Caveats

The guide is based on the `rust_gpiozero` crate which is still in development. This guide does not currently implement all of the steps in the   original _Physical Computing with Python_ guide.
